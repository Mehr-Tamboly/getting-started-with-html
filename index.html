  <b>The Web:</b> A collection of HTML documents made up Hypertext Markup Language (basis for almost all webpages.)Your browser makes requests via the internet to servers using a protocol called HTTP. Servers respond with files. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>HTML:</b> Hypertext markup language (heart of web)
    <br> 
    <br> 
    <p>HTML is made up of various aspects:  

<LI><b>-Text content</b>
<LI><b>-Mark up:</b> 
<xmp>    -<Name> contents </Name> â†’  whole thing is the element</xmp> 
<xmp>    -<Variable> Start Tag</xmp>
<xmp>    -</Variable> End Tag</xmp>
<xmp>    -<b> means bold </xmp>
<xmp>    -<em> means italicized </xmp>
<xmp>    -<Br> for line break (inline= ends text) </xmp>
<xmp>    -<p> content </p> For paragraphs (block= makes and invisible box) </xmp>
<xmp>    -<div> content </div> (block) </xmp>
<LI> <b> Links to other pages:</b>
<xmp>    -Html Attributes: <tag attr="value"> contents </Tag>  
    -Anchor-<a href="link">-for making links 
</xmp>
<LI> <b>References to other content:</b>
<xmp>    -<img>-images 
    -<img src="url" alt=text"> 
    -<span> content </span> (inline)
</xmp>  
</UL>

   <b> Why do only some lines of code have a start tag and an end tag?</b> 
   <br>Most HTML elements have a start tag and an end tag that indicate where the element begins and where it ends. There is a group of elements that are exceptions to this rule. These elements are called empty or void and only have a start tag since they can't have any content.
<br> 
<br> -HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
    <br> 
    <br> In HTML everything you do needs to be precise, computers dont have enough knowledge to know what you are always talking about like a human does.
